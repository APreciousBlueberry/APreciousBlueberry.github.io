  <p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1554369/">The Booth at the End</a> is a psychological thriller that consists entirely of a series of conversations that all take place in the namesake booth at the end. An apparently random group of strangers each enter into a pact with a mysterious figure. They believe he possesses the power to grant any wish, and in return they must carry out an assigned task.</p>
  <p>Officially, <cite>The Booth at the End</cite> was released as a TV show, but unofficially, each season consists of five 25-minute episodes, which adds up to a movie-length runtime. And so in this fan-edit, I joined whole episodes to turn it into the movie it secretly always was. My only changes to the content was to cut out "previously on"s and "next time on"s.</p>
