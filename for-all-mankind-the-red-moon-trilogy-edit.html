  <h1><img src="for-all-mankind-red-moon-splash.jpg" title="FOR ALL MANKIND ▶ The Red Moon Trilogy Edit" class="wide-img"></h1>
  <p>It's 1969 and the beginning of an alternate history as the Soviet Union lands the first man on the Moon, escalating the space race into a new race to establish the first permanent base on the Moon.</p>
  <p>In this TV-to-film fan-edit of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7772588/">For All Mankind</a>, I edited the first two seasons — the moon seasons — into a trilogy of films. I picked a few main characters to focus on, such as Ed and Molly in <b>Red Moon</b>, or Tracy and Gordo in <b>Red Moon 3 A City Upon a Hill</b>, and I adapted their stories into a movie format.</p>
  <p>You could almost call it an abridged version, except that I also re-ordered scenes to give the story a different feel and a different pace, such as the opening of <b>Red Moon 2 Into the Abyss</b>, for example, where I keep us at Jamestown for 20 claustrophobic minutes with no cutaways.</p>
  <p>The show's full runtime of the two moon seasons is: 20h 30m<br>
    This edit's combined runtime of the movie trilogy is: 6h 30m (Time cut: 14h)</p>

  <h2>Teaser <span style="font-weight: normal;">(3m)</span></h2>
  <p>In this teaser clip you'll see the lunar sunrise from season two, but edited to remove the chit-chat. I cut out Molly bantering with Wubbo about the camera, and I cut out Ellen giving us T-minus updates. In this edited version, the sunrise is instead a Villeneuve-style, dialog-free experience.</p>
