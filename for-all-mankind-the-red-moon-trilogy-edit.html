  <p>It's 1969 and the beginning of an alternate history as the Soviet Union lands the first man on the Moon, escalating the space race into a new race to establish the first permanent base on the Moon.</p>

  <h2>About This Edit</h2>
  <p>In this TV-to-film fan-edit of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7772588/">For All Mankind</a>, I edited the first two seasons — the moon seasons — into a trilogy of films. I picked a few main characters to focus on, such as Ed and Molly in <em>Red Moon</em>, or Tracy and Gordo in <em>Red Moon 3 A City Upon a Hill</em>, and I tell a tighter adaptation of their stories.</p>
  <p>You could <em>almost</em> call it an abridged version, except that I also re-ordered scenes to give the story a different feel and a different pace, such as the opening of <em>Red Moon 2 Into the Abyss</em>, for example, where I keep us at Jamestown for 20 claustrophobic minutes with no cutaways.</p>
  <p>The show's full runtime of those two seasons is 20h30m, and this fan-edit's combined runtime of the whole trilogy is 6h30m.</p>

  <h3>Teaser (3m)</h3>

  <p>In this teaser clip you'll see the lunar sunrise from season two, but edited to remove the chit-chat. I cut out Molly bantering with Wubbo about the camera, and I cut out Ellen giving us T-minus updates. In this edited version, the sunrise is instead a Villeneuve-style, dialog-free experience.</p>
