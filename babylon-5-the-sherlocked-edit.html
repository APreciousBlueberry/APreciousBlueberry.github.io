  <h1><img src="babylon-5-sherlocked-splash.jpg" title="BABYLON 5 ▶ The Sherlocked Edit" class="wide-img"></h1>
  <p>The year is 2257, and the Babylon station is constructed in neutral space between several major governments to provide a place for us to work out our problems peacefully. It is, we believe, our last, best hope for peace. But when a proxy war of ideology breaks out between two superpowers, Babylon 5 becomes something greater &mdash; our last, best hope for victory.</p>
  <p>In this TV-to-film fan-edit of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105946/">Babylon 5</a>, I carefully picked individual scenes from throughout each season of 22 episodes, and I restructured and recombined them in creative ways to assemble a trilogy of 1hr30min movies per season. The concept of this edit was inspired by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/">Sherlock</a>, which has an interesting and unconventional episode structure. Each season has just three episodes &mdash; <em>but</em> each episode is 90-minutes long. My goal with this edit is to make a version of Babylon 5 that fits that same episode structure, where each season is a trilogy of 90-minute movies.</p>
  <p>Each film is designed as a self-contained chapter with cohesive themes. The first movie, <b>1.1 Midnight on the Firing Line</b>, for example, tells a Shadow-themed story using scenes picked from throughout the entire first season, including the Shadow portion of the season one finale. Or the third movie, <b>1.3 The War Prayer</b>, which tells an Earth-themed story using scenes also picked from throughout the entire first season, and including the Earth portion of the season one finale.</p>
  <p>Babylon 5 is partly about sci-fi and fantasy, with stories of prophecies, visions, and time travel, and Babylon 5 is partly about the human experience, with stories of cycles of hatred, military coups, and worker strikes. This edit heavily focuses on the human stories.</p>
  <p>For fans who have already seen the original series, this version of Babylon 5 offers a fresh and cinematic way to experience the show. And for newcomers, this edit serves as an easier entry point. It moves at a faster pace while staying true to the spirit of the original work. The full original show is currently free to watch on <a href="https://tubitv.com/series/300010071/babylon-5">Tubi</a> and <a href="https://therokuchannel.roku.com/details/382d11be2c7e519b8105d835d3ab6b68/babylon-5">Roku</a>.

  <h2>If Your Time Is Short</h2>
  <p>Maybe you're interested in this edit but you don't want to commit to watching 16 movies. If your time is short and you want to watch only one, then here are a few suggestions you can pick from:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p><a href="#_41">4.1 Falling Toward Apotheosis</a> is worth your time because it's the story of a monarchy when the emperor goes mad. This edit lets you experience that story in a new way than in the original show, because in the original show the story of Cartagia and Centauri Prime was overshadowed by the climax of the Shadow War that was happening at the same time. But in this edit, I picked from just the Centauri scenes to create a movie that tells Cartagia's entire story, and I don't cut away to anywhere else.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="#_44">4.4 Intersections in Real Time</a> is worth your time because it's a psychological interrogation that frames a spy thriller when Garibaldi goes to Mars to work for Edgars. This edit lets you experience that story in a new way than in the original show, because in this edit I used a Nolan-inspired non-linear scene order. Chronologically, Sheridan's interrogation happens last, but in this movie I cold-open to the interrogation in a B&amp;W flashforward, and I return to the interrogation at the movie's midpoint and again at the movie's end.</p>
      <p>Also, the original show compressed a lot of story to fit within season four. JMS said that if he knew he would get a season five, then season four would have ended with <cite>Intersections in Real Time</cite>. And so in this edit, I followed that original plan, and this movie is what the season four finale might have been.</p></li>
    <li><p><a href="#_12">1.2 By Any Means Necessary</a> is worth your time because it's the filler movie. That may not sound like a selling point because the word "filler" has negative connotations, but not every movie needs to be Big Plot, and I've come to appreciate standalone anthology-style stories. In this edit, I weaved together scenes from several "filler" episodes to tell the story of the chaotically ordinary everyday life aboard Babylon 5, as the station's commander juggles the press, political rivalries, worker strikes, and the tensions between religious beliefs.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Progress Update</h2>
  <p>January 2026</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>I initially created each Sherlocked movie at a cadence of one movie every two weeks, and they're all ready to watch. I'm now doing a final pass and revisiting each movie to smooth the cuts and improve encoding quality. I updated <b>4.3 The Illusion of Truth</b> and <b>4.4 Intersections in Real Time</b>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>November 2025</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>I updated <b>4.1 Falling Toward Apotheosis</b> and <b>4.2 Into the Fire</b>, and for the first time during this final pass, I made a significant story change.</p>
      <p>In 4.1 Falling Toward Apotheosis, I cut the scenes of G'Kar searching for Garibaldi, and I replaced them with scenes from the S3 episode <b>A Day in the Strife</b>. In Strife, a Centauri-picked Narn representative arrives on the station to replace G'Kar and to pressure him to return home.</p>
      <p>Here's why I made that change. I want each movie to stand on its own and to tell a self-contained story. The crucial moment is when G'Kar makes a deal with Londo to free Narn. Prior to this moment, the plight of the Narn hadn't been shown or mentioned in <em>THIS</em> movie, which makes G'Kar's bargain appear to come out of the blue. But in this updated version, the movie vividly reminds us of the Centauri occupation and treatment of the Narn, and that vivid reminder makes the moment of G'Kar's deal more powerful.</p>
    </li>
    <li>The TV movie <b>In the Beginning</b> is currently available only as a DVD, and at DVD resolution. But now we might have something better, because user <a href="https://fanedit.org/forums/members/2x.58894/">2X</a> on IFDB shared their <a href="https://fanedit.org/forums/threads/babylon-5-in-the-beginning-upscale-restoration.33548/">In the Beginning upscale and restoration project</a>. The Sherlocked movie <b>1.1 Midnight on the Firing Line</b> contains 30 seconds of footage from In the Beginning, and I updated it to use 2X's upscaled version.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>What's Next</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm planning a final pass update to season 5.</li>
    <li>I'm planning to release <b>War Without End</b>. In the Sherlocked edit, the biggest storyline that didn't make the cut is Sinclair's mythology. There's no mention of his missing day, no time traveling B4, and no great machine. But now that changes, because I'm actively working on an extra Babylon 5 movie that will tell the entire Sinclair mythology story, from the battle of the line, to B4, to Valen.</li>
    <li>I'm planning to make a 6-minute <b>Amazing Shots of Babylon 5</b> video, using the extended Sierra video game music.</li>
  </ul>
