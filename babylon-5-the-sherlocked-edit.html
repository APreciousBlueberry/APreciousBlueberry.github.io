  <h1 class="heading">BABYLON 5 ▶ The Sherlocked Fan-Edit</h1>
  <p>It's 2257 and mankind stood on the eve of destruction. The Babylon station is constructed in neutral space between several major governments to provide a place for us to work out our problems peacefully. It is, we believe, our last, best hope for peace. But when a war of ideology breaks out between two superpowers, Babylon 5 becomes our last, best hope for victory.</p>

  <h2>About This Edit</h2>
  <p>In this TV-to-film fan-edit of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105946/">Babylon 5</a>, I selected individual scenes throughout each season of 22 episodes, and I recombined them in creative ways to assemble a trilogy of movies per season. This version of Babylon 5 offers a fresh and cinematic way to experience the show. It moves at a faster pace while staying true to the spirit of the original work.</p>
  <p>The concept of this fan-edit was inspired by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/">Sherlock</a>, which has an interesting and unconventional episode structure. Each season has just three episodes — <em>but</em> each episode is 90m long. Which means each season of Sherlock is ultimately a trilogy of movies. My goal with this fan-edit is to make a version of Babylon 5 that fits that same episode structure, where each season is a trilogy of 90m movies.</p>
  <p>Each movie aims to tell a self-contained story with cohesive themes. The first movie, for example, <em>Midnight on the Firing Line</em>, tells a Shadow-themed story, and it uses Shadow stories and scenes from all throughout the full show's first season. Likewise the third movie, <em>The War Prayer</em>, tells an Earth-themed story, and it uses Earth stories and scenes also from all throughout the full show's first season.</p>

  <h3>Editor's Highlights (9m)</h3>

  <h2>Future Updates</h2>
  <p>I created each of these movies at a cadence of one movie every two weeks, and it was very exciting when I made it to the end and released my <em>Sleeping in Light</em> fan-edit movie. I'm now doing a final pass through each movie, where I'm smoothing the cuts, fixing the dialog, and improving encoding quality, and this final pass is also progressing at a cadence of one movie every two weeks. By the end of October, I expect to be through the end of S4, and by the end of December I expect the final pass to be complete — <em>plus</em> one extra movie.</p>

  <h3>War Without End</h3>
  <p>The biggest storyline from the full show that didn't make the cut is Sinclair's mythology. In this Sherlocked fan-edit, there's no mention of his missing day, no time traveling B4, and no great machine.</p>
  <p>But that's going to change, because I'm actively working on a fan-edit movie that will tell the entire Sinclair mythology story, from the battle of the line, to B4, to Valen, and I'm pacing my work on this movie so that its release will coincide with the completion of the final pass of updates by the end of December. Stay tuned. :-)</p>
