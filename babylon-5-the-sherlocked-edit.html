  <h1><img src="babylon-5-sherlocked-splash.jpg" title="BABYLON 5 ▶ The Sherlocked Fan-Edit" class="wide-img"></h1>
  <p>The year is 2257, and the Babylon station is constructed in neutral space between several major governments to provide a place for us to work out our problems peacefully. It is, we believe, our last, best hope for peace. But when a proxy war of ideology breaks out between two superpowers, Babylon 5 becomes something greater &mdash; our last, best hope for victory.</p>
  <p>In this TV-to-film fan-edit of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105946/">Babylon 5</a>, I carefully picked individual scenes from throughout each season of 22 episodes, and I restructured and recombined them in creative ways to assemble a trilogy of 90-minute movies per season. Each film is designed as a self-contained chapter with cohesive themes, such as the rise of the Shadows in <b>Midnight on the Firing Line</b>, the turmoil on Earth in <b>The War Prayer</b>, or the personal journeys of the station's crew in <b>By Any Means Necessary</b>.</p>
  <p>The concept of this fan-edit was inspired by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/">Sherlock</a>, which has an interesting and unconventional episode structure. Each season has just three episodes — <em>but</em> each episode is 90m long. Which means each season of Sherlock is ultimately a trilogy of movies. My goal with this fan-edit is to make a version of Babylon 5 that fits that same episode structure, where each season is a trilogy of 90m movies.</p>
  <p>For fans who have already seen the original series, this version of Babylon 5 offers a fresh and cinematic way to experience the show. And for newcomers, this edit serves as an easier entry point. It moves at a faster pace while staying true to the spirit of the original work.</p>

  <h2>Editor's Highlights <span style="font-weight: normal;">(9m)</span></h2>
  <p>In this highlights video you'll see five clips that show how scenes were mixed, repurposed, and condensed. (Warning, SPOILERS!)</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Severed Dreams</b> mixed with <b>Convictions</b>: In Convictions there was a mad bomber, and an explosion left Londo and G'Kar trapped in an elevator. Several episodes later in Severed Dreams, there was a battle that caused severe damage to the station.<br>
      In this edit I mixed the elevator scenes into the battle, and I repurposed the elevator explosion to make it seem like it was caused by battle damage.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>And All My Dreams Torn Asunder</b> mixed and condensed with <b>Darkness Ascending</b>: In Darkness Ascending, Lennier witnesses a Centauri attack, then later in And All My Dreams Torn Asunder, Lennier recounts and replays that same attack.<br>
      In this edit I condensed those events by mixing the live event into the replay scene, and I reframed the live event as a flashback.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Midnight on the Firing Line</b> mixed with <b>Signs and Portents</b>: In Midnight on the Firing, Londo's nephew is possibly killed in a Narn attack, and Londo vows blood for blood. A dozen episodes later in Signs and Portents, Morden first arrives on the station to ask a question and offer his help to Londo.<br>
      In this edit I cut from Londo's vow of revenge directly to Morden's arrival. This mix works well as a segue since Morden will be the vehicle of Londo's revenge.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>The Summoning</b> mixed with <b>The Hour of the Wolf</b>: In The Hour of the Wolf, we see Sheridan encounter Lorien, then later in The Summoning, Sheridan returns to the station with Lorien alongside.<br>
      In this edit I reversed that order. I open with Sheridan returning to the station, and I show his encounter with Lorien through a series of flashbacks. (And I borrowed the flashback sound effect from Lost.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Conflicts of Interest</b> and <b>The Face of the Enemy</b> mixed with <b>Intersections in Real Time</b>: In Conflicts of Interest and The Face of the Enemy, Garibaldi starts working for Edgars and travels to Mars where he sets up Sheridan, then later in Intersections in Real Time, Sheridan is interrogated and tortured.<br>
      In this edit I used a Nolan-inspired style and I mixed the interrogation scenes into and throughout Garibaldi's story, and I reframed the interrogation as a series of black-and-white flashforwards.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Progress Update</h2>
  <p>September 2025</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I updated seasons 1, 2, and 3 of Babylon 5 Sherlocked. I initially created each Sherlocked movie at a cadence of one movie every two weeks, and they're all ready to watch. I'm now doing a final pass and revisiting each movie to smooth the cuts, fix dialog, and improve encoding quality.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>What's next:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm planning a final pass update to seasons 4 and 5.</li>
    <li>I'm planning to release <b>War Without End</b>. In the Sherlocked edit, the biggest storyline that didn't make the cut is Sinclair's mythology. In this edit, there's no mention of his missing day, no time traveling B4, and no great machine. But now that changes, because I'm actively working on an extra Babylon 5 movie that will tell the entire Sinclair mythology story, from the battle of the line, to B4, to Valen.</li>
    <li>I'm planning to make a 6-minute <b>Amazing Shots of Babylon 5</b> video, using the extended Sierra video game music.</li>
  </ul>
