  <h2><a href="babylon-5-the-sherlocked-edit.html">BABYLON 5 ▶ The Sherlocked Fan-Edit</a></h2>
  <p>It's 2257 and mankind stood on the eve of destruction. The Babylon station is constructed in neutral space between several major governments to provide a place for us to work out our problems peacefully. It is, we believe, our last, best hope for peace. But when a war of ideology breaks out between two superpowers, Babylon 5 becomes our last, best hope for victory.</p>
  <p>In this TV-to-film fan-edit of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105946/">Babylon 5</a>, I selected individual scenes throughout each season of 22 episodes, and I recombined them in creative ways to assemble a trilogy of movies per season. This version of Babylon 5 offers a fresh and cinematic way to experience the show. It moves at a faster pace while staying true to the spirit of the original work.</p>
  <p>The concept of this fan-edit was inspired by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/">Sherlock</a>, which has an interesting and unconventional episode structure. Each season has just three episodes — <em>but</em> each episode is 90m long. Which means each season of Sherlock is ultimately a trilogy of movies. My goal with this fan-edit is to make a version of Babylon 5 that fits that same episode structure, where each season is a trilogy of 90m movies.</p>
  <p>Each movie aims to tell a self-contained story with cohesive themes. The first movie, for example, <em>Midnight on the Firing Line</em>, tells a Shadow-themed story, and it uses Shadow stories and scenes from all throughout the full show's first season. Likewise the third movie, <em>The War Prayer</em>, tells an Earth-themed story, and it uses Earth stories and scenes also from all throughout the full show's first season.</p>

  <h2><a href="for-all-mankind-the-red-moon-trilogy-edit.html">FOR ALL MANKIND ▶ The Red Moon Trilogy Fan-Edit</a></h2>
  <p>It's 1969 and the beginning of an alternate history as the Soviet Union lands the first man on the Moon, escalating the space race into a new race to establish the first permanent base on the Moon.</p>
  <p>In this TV-to-film fan-edit of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7772588/">For All Mankind</a>, I edited the first two seasons — the moon seasons — into a trilogy of films. I picked a few main characters to focus on, such as Ed and Molly in <em>Red Moon</em>, or Tracy and Gordo in <em>Red Moon 3 A City Upon a Hill</em>, and I tell a tighter adaptation of their stories.</p>
  <p>You could <em>almost</em> call it an abridged version, except that I also re-ordered scenes to give the story a different feel and a different pace, such as the opening of <em>Red Moon 2 Into the Abyss</em>, for example, where I keep us at Jamestown for 20 claustrophobic minutes with no cutaways.</p>
  <p>In this teaser clip you'll see the lunar sunrise from season two, but edited to remove the chit-chat. I cut out Molly bantering with Wubbo about the camera, and I cut out Ellen giving us T-minus updates. In this edited version, the sunrise is instead a Villeneuve-style, dialog-free experience.</p>

  <h2><a href="mythic-quest-the-anthologies-edit.html">MYTHIC QUEST ▶ The Anthologies Fan-Edit</a></h2>
  <p>An anthology of four interconnected tales of passion and video games among the employees, players, and fans of the video game Mythic Quest.</p>
  <p>On most days the TV show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8879940/">Mythic Quest</a> is an office sitcom. But for one episode each season this show gives us a standalone anthology-style character story, known around the water cooler as The Backstory Episodes. Later, the spin-off show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt24512588/">Side Quest</a> continued this style of telling standalone anthology stories.</p>
  <p>In this fan-mix fan-edit, I picked from the <em>Mythic Quest</em> backstory episodes and the <em>Side Quest</em> episodes to assemble two anthology movies of four interconnected tales.</p>

  <h2><a href="justice-league-studio-no-crosscut-edit.html">ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE ▶ <span style="white-space: nowrap;">The Studio No-Crosscut Cut</span></a></h2>
  <p>Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg, and The Flash unite to save the world from an approaching threat.</p>
  <p>The original film has several storylines that all happen in parallel, and it crosscuts between them. We're with the Amazons for a bit, then we cut away to other storylines following Wayne, Aquaman, Lois, and Wonder Woman, then back to the Amazons for a bit, then we cut away to other storylines following Steppenwolf, Wayne, and Cyborg, then back to the Amazons for a bit, then we cut away to Cyborg again, then after more than an hour of runtime the Amazon storyline finally concludes when Wonder Woman deciphers the warning fire and retells the story to Batman.</p>
  <p>In this fan-edit I un-interleaved those stories and I arranged them sequentially rather than in parallel. In this fan-edit I open the film with the <em>Golden Age of Heros</em> sequence that introduces the boxes, followed immediately by the Amazon box waking and Steppenwolf's attack, followed immediately by the Amazon warning fire, followed immediately by Wonder Woman visiting the catacombs to decipher the warning. In this fan-edit, after only 20 minutes of runtime, the boxes are introduced and the Amazon storyline is concluded.</p>
  <p>The studio infamously wanted the Justice League movie to be two hours or less, and so in this fan-edit, that's what I did. Clocking in at 1h57m, this JL fan-edit is <em>THE</em> shortest of all the JL fan-edits, and it accomplishes the studio's desired runtime using only Zack Snyder's footage.</p>
  <p>In this highlights video you'll see clips from three action scenes. On the left of the screen you'll see a 3m unaltered clip from the original Justice League, then on the right of the screen you'll see my edited version, which generally clocks in at half the original runtime.</p>

  <h2><a href="annihilation-the-lacrimosa-edit.html">ANNIHILATION &amp; THE TREE OF LIFE ▶ The Lacrimosa Fan-Edit</a></h2>
  <p>Blackwater National Park reported that a lighthouse was surrounded by something they termed, a shimmer. We've sent in drones, animals, and teams of people — but nothing comes back. And the boundary is expanding.</p>
  <p>In this fan-mix fan-edit of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2798920/">Annihilation</a>, I take you into the shimmer straight away. In the original film we cross the boundary at 30 minutes, but in this fan-edit we cross the boundary at just 3 minutes. With the anomaly in front and the military in back, the audience can understand the situation without a word of dialog. I moved the exposition scenes to later and reframed them as a flashback.</p>
  <p>I also removed the college and infidelity scenes. The infidelity wasn't in the book and it feels like the movie added that to give the protagonist motivation. But I think the mystery of what happened to her dying husband is already enough motivation, and there's no catharsis or resolution to the infidelity angle. In this fan-edit, Lena's only backstory is that her husband was in a previous expedition, and even that is revealed slowly rather than expositioned up front.</p>
  <p>And finally I moved the meteor strike from the beginning of the film to the end of Act 2, which keeps more mystery about the source of the shimmer, and I combined the meteor strike with a selection from the Lacrimosa cosmos scene in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478304/">The Tree Of Life</a>. In the original film, Josie disappears, Lena has a brief panic attack, then <em>cut</em> and Lena is at the lighthouse. But in this fan-edit, Josie disappears, then The Tree of Life cosmos montage, then the meteor strike, then finally to Lena at the lighthouse.</p>
  <p>In this teaser clip you'll see the first 3 minutes of the fan-edit where we go into the shimmer straight away, and you'll see some quick glimpses of The Tree of Life that in the full fan-edit will appear at the end of Act 2.</p>

  <h2><a href="the-booth-at-the-end-edit.html">THE BOOTH AT THE END ▶ The Movie Fan-Edit</a></h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1554369/">The Booth at the End</a> is a psychological thriller that consists entirely of a series of conversations that all take place in the namesake booth at the end. An apparently random group of strangers each enter into a pact with a mysterious figure. They believe he possesses the power to grant any wish, and in return they must carry out an assigned task.</p>
  <p>Officially, The Booth at the End was released as a TV show. But unofficially, each season consists of five 25-minute episodes which adds up to a movie-length runtime. And so in this TV-to-film fan-edit, I joined whole episodes to turn it into the movie it secretly always was. My only changes to the content was to cut out 'previously on's and 'next time on's.</p>
