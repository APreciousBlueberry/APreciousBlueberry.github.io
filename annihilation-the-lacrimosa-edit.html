  <p>Blackwater National Park reported that a lighthouse was surrounded by something they termed, a shimmer. We've sent in drones, animals, and teams of people — but nothing comes back. And the boundary is expanding.</p>
  <p>In this fan-mix fan-edit of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2798920/">Annihilation</a>, I take you into the shimmer straight away. In the original film we cross the boundary at 30 minutes, but in this fan-edit we cross the boundary at just 3 minutes. With the anomaly in front and the military in back, the audience can understand the situation without a word of dialog. I moved the exposition scenes from the beginning of the film to later and I reframed them as a flashback.</p>
  <p>I also removed the college and infidelity scenes. The infidelity wasn't in the book and it feels like the movie added that to give the protagonist more motivation. But I think the mystery of what happened to her dying husband is already enough motivation, and there's no catharsis or resolution to the infidelity angle. In this fan-edit, Lena's only backstory is that her husband was in a previous expedition, and even that is revealed slowly rather than expositioned up front.</p>
  <p>And finally I moved the meteor strike from the beginning of the film to the end of Act 2, which keeps more mystery about the source of the shimmer, and I combined the meteor strike with a selection from the Lacrimosa cosmos scene in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478304/">The Tree Of Life</a>, which adds a sense of both wonder and suspense to the moment when Lena arrives at the climactic lighthouse.</p>
  <p>The original film's runtime is: 1h 55m<br>
    This fan-edit's runtime is: 1h 30m &hellip; Time cut: 25m</p>

  <h2>Teaser <span style="font-weight: normal;">(3m)</span></h2>
  <p>In this teaser clip you'll see the first 3 minutes of the fan-edit where we go into the shimmer straight away, and you'll see some quick glimpses of The Tree of Life that in the full fan-edit will appear at the end of Act 2.</p>
