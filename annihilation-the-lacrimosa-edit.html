  <p>Blackwater National Park reported that a lighthouse was surrounded by something they termed, a shimmer. We've sent in drones, animals, and teams of people — but nothing comes back. And the boundary is expanding.</p>

  <h2>About This Edit</h2>
  <p>In this fan-mix fan-edit of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2798920/">Annihilation</a>, I take you into the shimmer straight away. In the original film we cross the boundary at 30 minutes, but in this fan-edit we cross the boundary at just 3 minutes. With the anomaly in front and the military in back, the audience can understand the situation without a word of dialog. I moved the exposition scenes to later and reframed them as a flashback.</p>
  <p>I also removed the college and infidelity scenes. The infidelity wasn't in the book and it feels like the movie added that to give the protagonist motivation. But I think the mystery of what happened to her dying husband is already enough motivation, and there's no catharsis or resolution to the infidelity angle. In this fan-edit, Lena's only backstory is that her husband was in a previous expedition, and even that is revealed slowly rather than expositioned up front.</p>
  <p>And finally I moved the meteor strike from the beginning of the film to the end of Act 2, which keeps more mystery about the source of the shimmer, and I combined the meteor strike with a selection from the Lacrimosa cosmos scene in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478304/">The Tree Of Life</a>. In the original film, Josie disappears, Lena has a brief panic attack, then <em>cut</em> and Lena is at the lighthouse. But in this fan-edit, Josie disappears, then The Tree of Life cosmos montage, then the meteor strike, then finally to Lena at the lighthouse.</p>

  <p>In this teaser clip you'll see the first 3 minutes of the fan-edit where we go into the shimmer straight away, and you'll see some quick glimpses of The Tree of Life that in the full fan-edit will appear at the end of Act 2.</p>
