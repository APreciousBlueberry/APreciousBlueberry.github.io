  <h1><img src="mythic-quest-anthologies-splash.jpg" title="MYTHIC QUEST ▶ The Anthologies Edit" class="wide-img"></h1>
  <p>An anthology of four interconnected tales of passion and video games among the employees, players, and fans of the video game Mythic Quest.</p>

  <p>On most days the TV show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8879940/">Mythic Quest</a> is an office sitcom &mdash; but then they hit you with <cite>A Dark Quiet Death</cite>. This episode is a one-off anthology-style character story. "Shockingly good," is a common reaction from people who see it, as well as, "an absolute work of art," and, "the best episode of any TV show ever."</p>
  <p>But Mythic Quest didn't stop there, and they kept up the tradition of making one anthology-style character story each season. Later, the spin-off show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt24512588/">Side Quest</a> continued this style of telling standalone anthology stories.</p>
  <p>In this fan-edit, I picked from the Mythic Quest anthology episodes and the Side Quest episodes to assemble two movies of four interconnected tales, and I picked and arranged the stories to create a throughline across the anthologies.</p>
