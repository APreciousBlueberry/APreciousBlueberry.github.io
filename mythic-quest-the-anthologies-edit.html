  <h1><img src="mythic-quest-anthologies-splash.jpg" title="MYTHIC QUEST ▶ The Anthologies Edit" class="wide-img"></h1>
  <p>An anthology of four interconnected tales of passion and video games among the employees, players, and fans of the video game Mythic Quest.</p>

  <p>On most days the TV show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8879940/">Mythic Quest</a> is an office sitcom &mdash; but then they hit you with <cite>A Dark Quiet Death</cite>. This episode is a one-off, anthology-style character story. "Shockingly good," "an absolute work of art," and, "the best episode of any TV show ever," are common reactions from people who see it. But Mythic Quest didn't stop there, and each season they kept up the tradition of making one anthology-style character story. Later, the spin-off show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt24512588/">Side Quest</a> continued this style of telling standalone anthology stories.</p>
  <p>In this fan-mix fan-edit, I picked from the Mythic Quest and the Side Quest episodes to assemble two anthology movies of four interconnected tales, and I picked and arranged the stories to create a throughline across the anthologies.</p>
