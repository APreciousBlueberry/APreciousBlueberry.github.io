  <h1 class="heading">MYTHIC QUEST ▶ The Anthologies Fan-Edit</h1>
  <p>An anthology of four interconnected tales of passion and video games among the employees, players, and fans of the video game Mythic Quest.</p>

  <h2>About This Edit</h2>
  <p>On most days the TV show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8879940/">Mythic Quest</a> is an office sitcom. But for one episode each season this show gives us a standalone anthology-style character story, known around the water cooler as The Backstory Episodes. Later, the spin-off show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt24512588/">Side Quest</a> continued this style of telling standalone anthology stories.</p>
  <p>In this fan-mix fan-edit, I picked from the <em>Mythic Quest</em> backstory episodes and the <em>Side Quest</em> episodes to assemble two anthology movies of four interconnected tales.</p>
